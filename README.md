# KMeans-Clustering-C++

This is a code i made while taking the school subject "Datamining", in which we did all our programs in Python.

When we were learning KMeans, i did this code in C++ as part of a joke with/to my Teacher (who is Python Fanboy) to demonstrate the differences of how a code in Python could be done in over 4 times the same amount of lines.

### The code (what it does)

This code does an abstraction of the clustering used in KMeans, with only points (1D) we give 3 points which we want to use as Centroids and the program calculates the points closer to given points.

All comments and the program outputs are in spanish (as this was for a class, and i had to present it to the class)

### Extend to 2D

I believe firmly that this code can be easily extended from 1D to 2D, either with a data structure, or just with arrays/tuples, so could come in handy someday for completion, or even if need to do the full KMeans code in C++
